# cpu-tools

Something easily accessible where I can access different tools:

- custom searcher
    - nice to not have to re-input dozens of custom search engines and keywords into Edge. also don't have to be in a browser to get to it with a single keystroke. Similar to Pythonista (bring my Pythonista code into this repo as a separate folder?)
- on/off of a text replacement like on iOS
- OpenAI API
- see more in utilize_commands.py
