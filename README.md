# cpu-tools

Something easily accessible from Powershell where I can turn several toggles to:

- on/off of a text replacement like on iOS
- hotkey function triggers
- other pyautogui things
- always on top windows/other inspiration from WindowsPowerToys?

Also, my own searcher:
- nice to not have to re-input dozens of custom search engines and keywords into Edge. Similar to Pythonista
    - have it so it can be run as easily as possible. likely a keyboard shortcut far simpler than win x i and then some command. maybe like ctrl numlock
